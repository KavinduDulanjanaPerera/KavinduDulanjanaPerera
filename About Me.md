I am currently the Chairman for the IEEE Computer Society of SLIIT and an ambassador for IEEEXtreme. 
I previously volunteered as the Vice Secretary for The IEEE Student Branch. 
Being an Undergraduate of SLIIT specialising in Computer Systems and Network Engineering offered by the Curtin University of Australia, 
I was able to conquer a vast knowledge and experience on IT. 
I have been the lead on many projects and I'm a hard working individual with good organizational and management skills, 
specially being good at planning, teamwork, time management and critical thinking.
